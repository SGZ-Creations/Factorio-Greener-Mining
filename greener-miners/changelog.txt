Version: 0.2.3
Date: 1.12.20 
  Changes:
    - Changed date format.
    - Name changed from dustless-miner to Greener-Miners.
      - might keep old name in some areas or all. Hope not :p (currently settings need updates)
    - Recipes don't use pumps anymore, since it was anoying to lose all pumps from inventory while hand crafting. Genaral recipe changes for the miners is made to make it more smooth trough the game. Changes might still happen.
      recipies might be a bit more expensive, due to removal of other ingridiends. Later on am also planing to do bob's compatibility.
    - Dust to ore, recipe now uses water instead of sulfuric-acid. To make it a bit easier to convert to ore, since you already can put the dust in a furnaces anyway. Also to helps big modded games.
    - Changed some default startup setting. again to try smooth the miner unlock more out. If u play with default settings.
    - Changed some science requirements for t3-t5: t3 now needs production Science. t4 Now need Production & Uillity Science. t5 now needs Production, Utility & Space science.

Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2020.09.07
  Changes:
    - Changed the way dustcloud and dust are automatically being made at data stage where it copies data from the ore to get fuel values and such

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2020.09.07
  Features:
    - Added a new setting which allows setting the amount of dust required per ore in the duplicate recipes
    - Added new recipes to convert the dust into ore using a chemical plant
    - Added technologies to unlock the dustcloud to dust and dust to ore recipes
  Changes:
    - Changed dustcloud order from 'b[dust]-a[<dust-cloud-name>]' to 'z[dust]-a[<dust-cloud-name>]' so the dust clouds are most likely at bottom

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2020.08.29
  Major Features:
    - Added functionality that miners produce a fluid called "<ore-name> dust cloud" (that is coming out from the back)
  Features:
    - Added a command handler for "/dustlessminers". First argument can be either 'info' or 'reset' the second requires that you are admin on the server/map (The 'reset' command does not actually reset anything as it is meant to repair broken mod data)
    - Added dust clouds which are created by the miners when operating (map settings included :D)
    - Added dust which can be made from dust cloud and water in a chemical plant
    - Added functionality to duplicate recipes from ores to use the dust counterpart instead
  Graphics:
    - Changed the default textures to always use the wet variants for the miners
  Changes:
    - Changed T1 Miner Technology to require Oil Processing instead of Fluid Handling now that chemical plants are required to utilize the mining drills
  Optimisations:
    - The mod only updates a certain number of miners (setting key: "dustless-miners-per-tick" in map) every mod update (setting key: "dustless-tickspeed" in map)
    - Removed unused textures to minimize the required space, which is now down to sub 5 MB
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed a line in the changelog that caused factorio to not like it :,(
