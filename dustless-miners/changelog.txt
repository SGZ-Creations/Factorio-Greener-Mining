Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2020.08.24
  Major Features:
    - Added functionality that miners produce a fluid called dust clouds (that is coming out from the back)
  Features:
    - Added a command handler for "/dustlessminers".
    - First argument can be either 'info' or 'reset' the second requires that you are admin on the server/map (The 'reset' command does not actually reset it is meant repairs broken data)
    - Added dust clouds which are created by the miners when operating (map settings included :D)
    - Added dust which can be made from dust clouds and water in a chemical plant
    - Added functionality to duplicate recipes from ores to use the dust counterpart instead
  Graphics:
    - Changed the default textures to always use the wet variants for the miners
  Changes:
    - Changed T1 Miner Technology to require Oil Processing in stead of Fluid Handling now that chemical plants are required to utilize the miner
  Optimisations:
    - The mod only updates a certain number of miners (setting key: "dustless-miners-per-tick" in map) every mod update (setting key: "dustless-tickspeed" in map)
    - Removed un-neaded textures to minimize the required space now down to sub 5 MB
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed a line in the changelog that caused factorio to not like it :,(
