	"description": "This mod was made by the realistic thinking of getting rid of polution by dampening it with water, tho we stumble across an issue that won't be resolve by the game itself. So this mod is made a bit of a hacky way. Still we solved that by imagening us that the dust (polution) could be sucked up by vaccum. So that is waht this mod dose but wait it's more! \n\n Then u might ask yourself waht to we do with this dust (polution)? Well to aswer that. You will need some technoligy that can help you understand the dust wet then u can make ores out of this dust (polution) and for every 5 piece of dust u can make a plate out of it by tthe default recipe. \n\n this mod adds 5 tiers of miners witch has a goal to help u mine ore with less & less polution being produced as u upgrade your miners trough the game. \n 3rd thing you might not think of, is this also give u more resorces to hlep build your factory. \n ",
